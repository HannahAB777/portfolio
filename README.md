My first digital Portfolio,

this week I set to work on the advanced css week two homework, to produce a website that contained my portfolio for all future work. for the moment it is very basically set up, but will develop with me as my skills grow. there are links from a directory for "about me," "my work,"and "contact" which links to email. and if you click the first link you will find yourself on a page that links to my completed week one homework. I will be adding to and developing my portfolio over the course, but for now there are only simple pleasures to enjoy from a user prospective, such as hover sudo classes and a lovely bitmoji in place of my photograph. The site has some responsive design with some minor refinement needed.
